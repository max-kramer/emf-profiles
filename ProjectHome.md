# EMF Profiles #

EMF Profiles is an adaptation of the well-known UML profile concept to DSMLs. Profiles have been a key enabler for the success of UML by providing a lightweight language-inherent extension mechanism which is expressive enough to cover an important subset of adaptation scenarios. We believe a similar concept for DSMLs would provide an easier extension mechanism which has been so far neglected by current metamodeling tools. Apart from direct metamodel profiles, EMF Profiles also support reusable profile definition mechanisms whereby profiles are defined independently of any DSML and, later on, coupled with all DSMLs that can benefit from these profiles.

## How to install EMF Profiles? ##

EMF Profiles can be installed using our update site at **http://www.modelversioning.org/emf-profiles-updatesite/** as shown in the screencast "[Installing EMF Profiles](http://www.modelversioning.org/media/emf-profiles/installation/)".

## How to use EMF Profiles? ##

After you successfully installed EMF Profiles, open the "Profile Applications View" by clicking _Window -> Show view -> Other -> EMF Profiles/Profiles Application_. Now you can start by creating a new profile definition as shown in the screencast "[Standard Profile Support](http://www.modelversioning.org/media/emf-profiles/EJBprofile/EJBprofile.htm)". Once the profile is specified, you can start applying it to arbitrary models conforming to the extended metaclasses.
